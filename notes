🌐 Introduction to AWS

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
It offers on-demand services such as computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, and more — all delivered over the internet (the “cloud”).

⚙️ Key Idea

Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers or data centers, organizations can use AWS to:

Run applications

Store data

Host websites

Analyze information

Deploy software globally

This helps save cost, time, and resources.

☁️ Main Categories of AWS Services

Compute – Services that provide processing power.
Example: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Storage – For saving and retrieving data.
Example: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Database – Managed databases for structured and unstructured data.
Example: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)

Networking – Services for secure and fast network connections.
Example: Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Security & Identity – To control access and protect resources.
Example: IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Machine Learning, Analytics, and DevOps tools – For smart automation and monitoring.

💡 Benefits of AWS

Scalable: Easily increase or decrease resources as needed.

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.

Reliable: High availability and uptime.

Secure: Strong encryption and access control.

Global Reach: Data centers around the world.

🧭 Example

If you want to host a website:

Use EC2 to run the server,

Use S3 to store images/files,

Use RDS for your database,

Use CloudFront to deliver content faster worldwide.




☁️ Core Elements of AWS (Amazon Web Services)

AWS has four main core elements (or pillars) that form the base of all its services.

🧱 1. Compute

These services give you processing power — basically, virtual servers that run your applications.

🔹 Examples:

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Run virtual machines.

AWS Lambda: Run code without managing servers (serverless).

Elastic Beanstalk: Easy app deployment.

ECS / EKS: Run containerized applications (Docker, Kubernetes).

💡 Think of Compute as — “Brains” of AWS.

💾 2. Storage

Storage services let you store and manage data safely and flexibly.

🔹 Examples:

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Store files, images, backups, etc.

EBS (Elastic Block Store): Storage for EC2 instances.

Amazon Glacier: Low-cost long-term storage (archiving).

💡 Think of Storage as — “Memory” of AWS.

🌐 3. Networking

These services help connect your AWS resources securely to the internet and to each other.

🔹 Examples:

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Create private networks inside AWS.

Route 53: Domain Name System (DNS) service.

CloudFront: Content delivery (CDN).

API Gateway: Manage and publish APIs.

💡 Think of Networking as — “Communication system” of AWS.

🗄️ 4. Database

AWS provides managed databases for structured and unstructured data.

🔹 Examples:

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL.

DynamoDB: NoSQL database.

Aurora: High-performance relational database.

Redshift: Data warehouse for analytics.

💡 Think of Database as — “Information storage and organization” of AWS.

🧠 Bonus: Other Important Areas

Besides the 4 main core elements, AWS also includes:

Security & Identity (IAM, KMS, Cognito)

Monitoring & Management (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)

DevOps Tools (CodeBuild, CodePipeline)

Machine Learning & Analytics (SageMaker, Athena)
