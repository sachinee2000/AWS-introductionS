🌐 What is a NAT Gateway?

NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation Gateway) is an AWS-managed service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet (for things like software updates or downloading packages) — without exposing those instances to inbound internet traffic.

🧩 Why we use NAT Gateway:

In AWS, we often divide a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) into:

Public Subnet: Has access to the internet through an Internet Gateway.

Private Subnet: Does not have direct internet access (for security reasons).

However, sometimes instances (like application servers or databases) in the private subnet need to:

Download software updates

Connect to external APIs

Send data to other internet services

➡️ That’s where NAT Gateway comes in.

⚙️ How it works (Simplified):

A private EC2 instance sends a request to the internet (e.g., to get updates).

The traffic goes from the private subnet → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet.

The response comes back through the same path.

✅ The instance can access the internet,
❌ But the internet cannot directly access the instance.

🏗️ Where it lives:

NAT Gateway is created in a public subnet.

The private subnet’s route table routes internet-bound traffic to the NAT Gateway.

🔒 Key Benefits:

Keeps private resources secure (no direct inbound access).

Managed service — AWS handles scaling, fault tolerance, and availability.

High performance — handles gigabits of traffic automatically.

Subnet Type        	Resource	        Internet Access	       How

1.Public Subnet    	Web Server	         Yes	               Through Internet Gateway
2.Private Subnet	  App/DB Server	      Outbound only	       Through NAT Gateway
